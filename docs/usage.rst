Working with the API
====================

This API exposes several objects that will allow an application to do the same
actions the user can do in the website. These actions include:
- Reading comics (getting information about the strips and marking
them as read).
- Choosing what comics to read
- Request new comics

The next sections will describe with more detail what objects can be
retrieved and their structure.
